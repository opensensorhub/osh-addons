/**
 * Sensor driver that can read UAS data from a MISB transport stream.
 * <p>
 * This is one of two sensors defined in this package (the other being {@link UasSensor}). This one provides the same
 * functionality as the other, except that it does not stream data from the source when there are no OpenSensorHub
 * clients subscribed for its data.
 * <p>
 * Since it does not connect to the stream right away, the sensor cannot know video frame information (pixel
 * size and codec) at initialization time. So the user has to provide that info as part of its configuration.
